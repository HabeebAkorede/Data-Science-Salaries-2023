# Introduction:
In this project, I will be conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualization of the dataset to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform salary negotiations and career decisions in the field of data science.

### Concepts Applied:
1.	Descriptive statistics
2.	Data cleaning
3.	Hypothesis Testing

# Data Sourcing:
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023). 

It contains 11 columns, each are:
- work_year: The year the salary was paid.
- experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year
- employment_type: The type of employment for the role

# Problem statement 
1. What are Top 10 Data science job titles in 2023?
2.	Which data science Job titles earn the top salaries?
3.	Which is the top experience level of data scientists in 2023?
4.	What types of employment arrangements are common in this field?
5.  What is the top salaries by these employment arrangement?

# Data Cleaning
- Making the first row as header and capitalizing the first word for easy readability
- I changed data type from General to Text, Currency and Number where applicable
- I standardized abbreviations using Find/Replace 
- filtered the data to meet certain conditions and checked for blanks
- data aggregation
